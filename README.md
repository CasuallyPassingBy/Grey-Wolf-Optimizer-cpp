# Grey Wolf Optimizer in C++

This is a C++ implementation of the meta-heuristic based on the grey wolves hunting patterns :wolf:. This implementation is based on the [research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260010809_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer) that first published this meta-heuristic. 

This projects implemnts the **Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)**, a nature inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting of grey wolves üê∫. The algorithm is tested on multiple benchmark functions.

# Summary

The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. The algorithm simulates the leadership structure of a wolf pack, where alpha, beta, and delta wolves guide the search process, while omega wolves follow their lead.

 The hunting process consists of encircling prey, tracking, and attacking, making GWO effective for solving complex optimization problems.
