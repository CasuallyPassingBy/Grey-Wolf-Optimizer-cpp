# Grey Wolf Optimizer in C++

This is a C++ implementation of the meta-heuristic based on the grey wolves hunting patterns :wolf:. This implementation is based on the [research paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260010809_Grey_Wolf_Optimizer) that first published this meta-heuristic. 

This projects implemnts the **Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)**, a nature inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting of grey wolves üê∫. The algorithm is tested on multiple benchmark functions.

# Summary

The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. The algorithm simulates the leadership structure of a wolf pack, where alpha, beta, and delta wolves guide the search process, while omega wolves follow their lead.

 The hunting process consists of encircling prey, tracking, and attacking, making GWO effective for solving complex optimization problems.

# Features
- Implementation of the Grey Wolf Optimizer
- Optimization of various [benchmark functions](benchmark_functions.md)
- Supports parameter tuning for population size, iterations, and repetitions
- Uses C++ for efficient computation

# Prerequisites
To build and run the project, you need:
- A C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later.
- CMake (optional, for better build management)

# Installation
1. Clone the repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CasuallyPassingBy/Grey-Wolf-Optimizer-cpp.git
```
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g. g++ for GCC)

# Usage 
Modify `Tesing.cpp` to optimize different functions or adjust the parameters:
```cpp
const int population = 20;    // Number of wolves
const int iterations = 1000;  // Number of iterations
const int repetitions = 30;   // Number of repetitions
```
You can replace the benchmark function being optimized:
```cpp
function<double(vector<double>)> target_function = Ackley;
```

# Compilation
To compile the project using g++, run:
```bash
g++ -o optimizer src/Testing.cpp src/GWO.cpp src/functions.cpp
```
Then, excute the program:
```bash
./optimizer
```
This will optimize various benchmark functions using the GWO algorithm and output the results.
